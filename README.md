NOTE: The production [website](http://novabot.me) is currently using Stellar TestNet

NovaBot is a chat bot integrated into the Twitch platform's chat.

It facilitates the transfer of Stellar Lumens (XLM), a cryptocurrency, between viewers of live-streams and the broadcaster. The goal here is to expand the number of donation mechanisms so even the smaller content creators can earn a living on Twitch more easily.

It also provides a basic set of chat commands and includes a dashboard to help enable NovaBot on broadcasters' channels. Twitch users can deposit and withdraw XLM from the NovaBot dashboard.
